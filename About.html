<p>By now I hope I would have created a positive and fine impact on you guys out there checking out my portfolio.If u liked me and my portfolio design and if you have become curious about me and my life then I would suggest you to grab a warm cup of coffee and get comfortable to let yourselves get deeper into my life and know more babout me since I am summarising my story here.</p>
<p>I was born and brought in the holy city of Varanasi,India. I studied in an ICSE board school till class 10th. I was extremely meritoriuos and used to excel in all the exams.I like maths and science so i chose the PCM stream and completed my intermediate studies in Kota,Rajasthan.Finally I got into a decent college from where I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree.</p>
<p>Right from my childhood I was very much interested in technologies and innovations and here I am on my way learning technological skills.I believe in hard work and no matter how many times I fail,I will keep working for my dreams to come true.</p>
